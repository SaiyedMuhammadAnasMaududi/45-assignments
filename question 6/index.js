// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
//Exercise of Q.10 Second program till the commented part.
/*in this program below we are going to make it visible that the space between chracter's exist.*/
var whitespace = "\tAnas\n Maududi";
console.log(whitespace);
var withoutwhitespace = "Anas Maududi";
console.log(withoutwhitespace);
